== INSTALL ==

After having enabled this module, go to admin/settings/imageapi, select
'ImageAPI Optimize' as the default toolkit, then admin/settings/imageapi/config,
adjust your settings.

ImageAPI can use 3rd service like Yahoo! SmushIt, all that you needs is PHP 5.2+
with JSON support.

In order to have better performance, it is preferred to compile your selected
tools and give the paths to ImageAPI Optimize.

== NOTES ==
Everytime you install a new ImageAPI contrib module, go to the ImageAPI Optimize
settings page and save the configuration.
